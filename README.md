## Overview

This project aims to provide detailed guidelines for transitioning from a traditional Waterfall development model to a Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in login systems, container services, and APIs.

## Integrating SDLC

### Reorganize the Waterfall Task List

Reorganize the existing development tasks from the Waterfall task list into the Secure SDLC phases. Ensure each phase incorporates necessary security tasks to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the cryptocurrency platform.

#### Secure SDLC Phases

1. **Planning**
   - Original Task: Define project scope.
   - Additional Security Task: Perform initial risk assessment.

2. **Requirements**
   - Original Task: Gather requirements from stakeholders.
   - Additional Security Task: Identify security requirements and compliance needs.

3. **Design**
   - Original Task: Design system architecture.
   - Additional Security Task: Conduct threat modeling and design security controls.

4. **Implementation**
   - Original Task: Develop codebase.
   - Additional Security Task: Implement secure coding practices and static code analysis.

5. **Testing**
   - Original Task: Perform functional testing.
   - Additional Security Task: Conduct security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

6. **Deployment**
   - Original Task: Deploy application to production.
   - Additional Security Task: Perform final security review and apply security configurations.

### Advocating for Secure SDLC

List and explain five essential advantages of transitioning to the Secure SDLC:

1. **Early Detection of Vulnerabilities**: Identifying and mitigating risks early reduces costs associated with late-stage fixes.
2. **Compliance and Standards Adherence**: Ensures development complies with relevant security standards and regulations.
3. **Enhanced Risk Management**: Continuous risk assessment improves the overall security posture.
4. **Improved Product Quality**: Embedding security practices enhances reliability and robustness.
5. **Customer Trust and Confidence**: A secure development process fosters customer trust.

## Vulnerabilities and Remediation

### Identifying Vulnerabilities in Login Systems

Identify three potential vulnerabilities in a login system and propose effective remediation strategies:

1. **Weak Password Policies**
   - **Description**: Users can create weak passwords.
   - **Risk**: Increases the likelihood of unauthorized access.
   - **Remediation**: Implement strong password policies, including complexity requirements.

2. **Lack of Account Lockout Mechanism**
   - **Description**: No lockout after multiple failed login attempts.
   - **Risk**: Allows unlimited attempts to guess passwords.
   - **Remediation**: Introduce account lockout mechanisms.

3. **Insufficient Session Management**
   - **Description**: Sessions do not expire or are predictable.
   - **Risk**: Increases the risk of session hijacking.
   - **Remediation**: Implement secure session management practices.

### Creating a Threat Matrix

Assess the impact and likelihood of identified vulnerabilities:

| Vulnerability                    | Impact Level | Likelihood |
|----------------------------------|--------------|------------|
| Weak Password Policies           | High         | High       |
| Lack of Account Lockout Mechanism| Medium       | High       |
| Insufficient Session Management  | High         | Medium     |

## Container Security

### Trivy Scan and Remediation

Run a Trivy scan against the container located at `vulnerables/cve-2014-6271` and document the results.

1. **Scan Results**
   - Include a screenshot of the Trivy scan results.

2. **Report to Fix Container Issues**
   - Identify at least 7 vulnerabilities.
   - Provide details including the CVE number, unpatched and patched software versions, and remediation strategies.

## API Security

### Identifying and Remediating API Vulnerabilities

Identify three common API vulnerabilities and propose remediation strategies:

1. **Broken Object Level Authorization**
   - **Description**: Exposes endpoints that handle object identifiers.
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
   - **Remediation**: Implement proper access controls and validation checks.

2. **Insufficient Rate Limiting**
   - **Description**: No rate limits, allowing excessive requests.
   - **Risk**: DoS attacks and resource exhaustion.
   - **Remediation**: Implement rate limiting.

3. **Data Exposure Through Inadequate Encryption**
   - **Description**: Sensitive data transmitted without proper encryption.
   - **Risk**: Exposure of sensitive information.
   - **Remediation**: Use strong encryption protocols for data transmission and storage.

## Conclusion

By following this comprehensive approach, CryptoV4ULT can ensure its infrastructure is developed securely, mitigating risks and enhancing the overall security posture of its cryptocurrency platform.
